##ARIMA Analysis on daily number of sales on consumable products

The company I work for has specific products that we consider "Consumable". Think Lumber, or building materials.
This is an anlysis on the number of consumable items bought daily from a specific sales avenue, a website, representing as a time-series

The intention of this project was to dive into ARIMA analysis and its statistical components to forecast the amount of consumable we should expect to sell.

<b>Some difficulties I ran into:</b>
- First and foremost was the dataset itself. It seemed to be white noise, tried some differencing and other stationarity techniques, but trudged on
- Whether it was just the dataset or not, the predicition and forecast portion toward the end still needs some work and will be improved upon in the future.
